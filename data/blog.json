      "content": "TypeScript has become the standard for building large-scale JavaScript applications. This beginner's guide will help you get started with TypeScript and understand its key concepts.\n\n## What is TypeScript?\n\nTypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking. It compiles to plain JavaScript and provides better tooling and error detection.\n\n## Why Use TypeScript?\n\n### Type Safety\n\nCatch errors at compile time rather than runtime.\n\n### Better IDE Support\n\nEnhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation.\n\n### Improved Documentation\n\nTypes serve as inline documentation for your code.\n\n## Basic Types\n\n```typescript\n// Primitive types\nlet name: string = 'John';\nlet age: number = 30;\nlet isActive: boolean = true;\n\n// Arrays\nlet numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\nlet names: Array<string> = ['John', 'Jane'];\n\n// Objects\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Install TypeScript: `npm install -g typescript`\n2. Create a `tsconfig.json` file\n3. Start writing TypeScript code\n4. Compile with `tsc`\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Interfaces\n\nDefine the shape of objects with interfaces.\n\n### Generics\n\nCreate reusable components that work with multiple types.\n\n### Type Inference\n\nTypeScript can often infer types automatically.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Use strict mode for better type checking\n- Leverage type inference when possible\n- Create custom types for domain concepts\n- Use union types for flexibility\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTypeScript provides powerful tools for building robust applications. Start with the basics and gradually adopt more advanced features as you become comfortable.",
