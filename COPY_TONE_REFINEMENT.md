# Copy Tone Refinement Report
## Apple-Style Language Implementation

### ✅ Principles Applied

**Use:**

### ✅ Language Patterns

**Quiet Confidence:**
- "We help organizations..." (not "We transform organizations...")
- "Designed for..." (not "Built with cutting-edge...")
- "Built to support..." (not "Powerful solutions that...")
- "Trusted by..." (not "Leading provider of...")

**Reassuring, Not Impressive:**
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Direct statements, not hyperbole
- Factual descriptions, not marketing claims
- Clear communication, not buzzwords

### ✅ Result

The copy now:
- **Reassures** rather than impresses
- **Clarifies** what the company does
- **Builds trust** through quiet confidence
- **Guides users forward** with clear, direct language

All copy follows the principle: A world-class site doesn't try to impress. It reassures.
